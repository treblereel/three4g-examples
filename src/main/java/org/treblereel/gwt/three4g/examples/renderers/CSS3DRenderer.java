/**
 * CSS3DRenderer can be used to apply hierarchical 3D transformations to DOM elements via the CSS3 transform property. This renderer is particular interesting if you want to apply 3D effects to a website without canvas based rendering. It can also be used in order to combine DOM elements with WebGL content.
 * <p>
 * There are, however, some important limitations:
 * <p>
 * It's not possible to use the material system of three.js.
 * It's also not possible to use geometries.
 * So CSS3DRenderer is just focused on ordinary DOM elements. These elements are wrapped into special objects (CSS3DObject or CSS3DSprite) and then added to the scene graph.
