/**
 * A loader for loading a .prwm resource.
 * Packed Raw WebGL Model is an open-source binary file format for nD geometries specifically designed for JavaScript and WebGL with a strong focus on fast parsing (from 1ms to 0.1ms in Chrome 59 on a MBP Late 2013). The parsing of PRWM file is especially fast when the endianness of the file is the same as the endianness of the client platform. More information on this here https://github.com/kchapelier/PRWM.
